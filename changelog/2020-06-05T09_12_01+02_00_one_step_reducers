CHANGED: The hardwired functions to unroll primitive definitions for 'zipWith', 'map', 'foldr', and 'init' have been changed to only unroll a single step, whereas they would previously unroll the whole definition in one step. This allows Clash to take advantage of the lazy nature of these functions, in turn speeding up compilation speeds significantly in some cases. Part of [PR 1354](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/pull/1354).
